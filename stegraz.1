\fBNAME\fP
       \fBstegraz\fP - Steganography static analysis Tool 

\fBSYNOPSIS\fP
       stegraz [ options ] <file> [ grep_argument ]

\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
       \fBstegraz\fP is a steganography static analysis tool, gathers most known commands to analyze files for hidden data. 
       It supports various file formats (not just images) and provides a range of features (to save time)

       Features include:
       - Opening image files in Eye of GNOME for visual inspection.
       - Determining the file type of the input file.
       - Extracting strings from the file and filtering using grep (optional).
       - Extracting metadata from the file using exiftool.
       - Extracting embedded files using binwalk -e.
       - Editing the file in hexadecimal mode using hexedit.
       - Extracting and fixing corrupted archives. (ex: unzip -FF)
       - Decrypting strings encoded in many different bases Simultaneously (Base16, Base32, Base62, Base64, Base85, Base91).

\fBOPTIONS\fP
       -h, --help, -help, man
              Display this manual page.

       -b, --decrypt <string>
              Decrypt a string using various base encoding schemes and save result in a temporary file.

\fBEXAMPLES\fP
       Analyze an image file:
       stegraz image.png
       (it will display what feature will be applied, press "ENTER" to apply it or "S+ENTER" to skip to the next feature).

       Extract strings from a file and filter for a specific pattern:
       stegraz secret.txt "flag format"

       Decrypt an encoded string in different bases in case you dont know from which base you should exactly decode:
       stegraz -b "AU%d'E,9).De:,&ARfXhBl7Q+GA2/4+EMX9B6%F,"

\fBNOTES\fP
       - Some features may require external tools to be installed, such as Eye of GNOME, hexedit, binwalk, exiftool, unzip, and unrar.
       - while decoding the bases use double quotes "" instead of single quotes '' as they might be sometimes part of same base encodings.
